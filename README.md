Little helper when measuring stems.

Lists all currently open ufo’s and displays horizontal and vertical stemSnap values.
Additionally, on having 2 points selected, it can add vertical or horizontal stems, and remove the last stem value in the list.  
The `Clear values` button obviuosly removes all stem values (horizontal and vertical), from all open fonts.

### Note:
- Currently the table only takes ufo’s that are already open into account. If you open additional ufo’s after the script was run, click the `Update` button.
- The changes are currently only in memory, so you need to save the fonts manually before closing them.

## This is a work in progress, so a few QoL improvements will be added in the future.

- [ ] automatically save after adding/removing values
- [ ] implement subscribers so the refresh button can go away.
